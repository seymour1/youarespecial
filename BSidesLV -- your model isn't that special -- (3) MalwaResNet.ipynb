Even if **<span style=\"color:#CC1111\">Malwa</span>ResNet** were a killer architecture for malware, it'd need to be trained on a lot more than a paltry 100K malicious/benign samples, and the optimization and architecture would need some revamping (for example, ResNet is trained over hundreds of epochs...on metric ton of relatively small images).  But as it is, this *special* model isn't really even close in performance to our *not special* multilayer perceptron.
